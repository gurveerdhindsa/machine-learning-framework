The goal of this team project is to come up with a very simple environment for performing machine learning on simple problems. Machine learning is a set of techniques where you use past examples to make predictions about new ones. 

An example is described by an input (described by a set of features), and an output. A training example has values for each feature and for the output, whereas a testing example only has values for the features, but the output is the job of the machine learning algorithm to figure out. It does so by looking for patterns and correlations between features and outputs in the training examples. The particular technique is called “k-Nearest Neighbours”, or kNN. For a given test example, the kNN algorithm finds, as its name indicates, the k “nearest” examples by using a combination of distance functions for the features.
